    <h1>TERMS & CONDITIONS</h1>
    <h3>Posted March 23/22</h3>
    <p>Monastery Gyatso NFT is a collection of digital caps based on our physical cap, The Gyatso. It runs as a non-fungible token on the ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN. Monasterynft.com is the only webpage to mint this NFT. Later on, it will be available on secondary markets like OpenSea. Users are entirely responsible for the safety and management of their own private Ethereum wallets and validating all transactions and contracts generated by this website before approval. Additionally, it is essential to mention that it is impossible to undo, reverse or restore any transactions as the Monastery Gyatso NFT smart contract runs on the Ethereum network.</p>
    <p>This website and its connected services are provided “as is” and “as available” without a warranty of any kind. By using this website, you accept sole responsibility for all transactions involving Monastery Gyatso NFT digital collection.</p>
    <p>A. The buyer, in this case, you, owns the NFT. Each Monastery Gyatso is an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. When you purchase an NFT, you own the underlying Monastery Gyatso NFT, which means you own the art completely. Ownership of the NFT is regulated entirely by the Smart Contract and the Ethereum Network: do not expect us to modify, freeze or even seize your Monastery Gyatso.
        B. Personal Use. Along with the respect and continued compliance you give to these Terms, Monastery S.A.S. grants you a worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art, along with any extensions that you choose to create or use, solely for the following purposes: (i) for non -commercial use, only for your own personal; (ii) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your Monastery Gyatso NFT, these marketplaces must count with the option to cryptographically verify each Monastery Gyatso NFT owner’s rights to display the Art for their Monastery Gyatso in orden to grant that only the actual owner can display the Art; or (iii) as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your Monastery Gyatso NFT, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each Monastery Gyatso NFT owner’s rights to display the Art for their Monastery Gyatso NFT to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Monastery Gyatso NFT leaves the website/application.
        C. Commercial Use. Along with respect and continued compliance you give to these Terms, Monastery S.A.S. grants you an unlimited, worldwide license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art with the objective and possibility of creating derivative works based upon the Art. Examples of the Commercial Use described would be the use of the Art to produce and sell merchandise products (Clothes etc.) displaying copies of the Art. For clarification purposes, nothing in this Section will restrict you from (i) owning or operating a marketplace that permits the use and sale of Monastery Gyatso NFTs generally, ensuring that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Monastery Gyatso NFT owner’s rights to display the Art for their Monastery Gyatso NFT to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; (ii) owning or operating a third-party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of Monastery Gyatso NFT generally, ensuring that the third-party website or application cryptographically verifies each Monastery Gyatso NFT owner’s rights to display the Art for their Monastery Gyatso NFT to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased Monastery Gyatso NFT leaves the website/application; or (iii) earning revenue from any of the foregoing.
